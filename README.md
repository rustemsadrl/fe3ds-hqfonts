# fe3ds-hqfonts

## What this does
Tired of blurry fonts while playing Fire Emblem on Citra? Well I've got something for you.

## How to
Extract System*.bfnt from your desired Fire Emblem 3DS ROM and those into input folder.
```
g++ .\bfntsCharacterMarkup.cpp
.\a.exe
python .\drawFont.py
```
Now you might be thinking that this is not an elegant solution. And you would be right.
